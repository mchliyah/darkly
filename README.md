## Overview

This project aims to teach the basics of **cybersecurity** by auditing a vulnerable website. You will explore common **web vulnerabilities**, understand how attackers exploit them, and develop the skills to identify and mitigate security risks in web applications.

## Key Skills Learned

- **Web Vulnerability Identification**: Learn how to identify common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
- **OWASP Top 10**: Gain hands-on experience with the OWASP Top 10 security risks and how they affect web applications.
- **Ethical Hacking**: Understand the principles of ethical hacking and how to responsibly exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- **Security Auditing Techniques**: Practice auditing a website for security flaws, using tools and manual techniques.
- **Documentation & Reporting**: Learn to document your findings, providing clear explanations of how vulnerabilities were exploited and how to fix them.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Master the process of exploiting vulnerabilities and proving your findings with evidence.

## Project Structure

The project requires completing 14 different security breaches, documenting the process, and submitting a report with your findings. All work is organized into a directory structure for each breach.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the virtual machine (i386)** using the provided ISO image.
2. Access the vulnerable website:  
   `http://172.16.60.128`
3. Audit the website and identify vulnerabilities. Exploit each breach and document your process.
4. Submit a folder containing all the necessary files and evidence for each breach you exploited.

## Deliverables

Your submission should include:
- A folder for each breach, with detailed steps, explanations, and proof of exploitation.
- A **flag** file for each breach showing your success.
- No external binaries or unnecessary files should be included in the submission.

## Conclusion

This project provides an introduction to **ethical hacking** and **web application security**. By completing it, you will gain valuable experience in identifying vulnerabilities and securing web applications, which is a critical skill for anyone in cybersecurity.
